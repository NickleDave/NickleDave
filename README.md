<https://github.com/NickleDave/hybrid-vocal-classifier>  
A library for comparing supervised learning algorithms that automate labeling 
the elements of birdsong

- **evfuncs**  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/evfuncs>  
Functions for working with files created by the EvTAF program and the evsonganaly GUI.  
The functions can be used to work with Bengalese finch song in this data repository:

- **ML-comparison-birdsong**  
https://github.com/NickleDave/ML-comparison-birdsong  
Code to accompany the SciPy 2016 Proceedings Paper "Comparison of machine 
learning methods applied to birdsong element classification"  
<http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2016/david_nicholson.html>  

- **songdkl**  
https://github.com/NickleDave/songdkl  
a measure of similarity between birdsongs (and other things)  
As described in:  
Mets, David G., and Michael S. Brainard.
"An automated approach to the quantitation of vocalizations and vocal learning in the songbird."
PLoS computational biology 14.8 (2018): e1006437.  
<https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006437&rev=2>
