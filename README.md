# About me
I do research in the areas of
machine learning, artificial intelligence, cognition, and neuroscience.

## data science tools for animal vocalizations and bioacoustics
My work in applied machine learning focuses mainly on tools for 
animal vocalizations and bioacoustics.

- **TweetyNet**  
Most recently, I collaborated with [Yarden Cohen](https://yardencsgithub.github.io/)
and [Tim Gardner](http://www.bu.edu/biology/people/profiles/tim-gardner/)
to develop a neural network that learns
how to annotate birdsong from spectrograms:  
<https://github.com/yardencsGitHub/tweetynet>  

- **vak**  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/vak>  
neural network toolbox for animal vocalizations and bioacoustics

- **Crowsetta**  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/crowsetta>  
a tool to work with any format for annotating animal vocalizations

- **hybrid-vocal-classifier**: a Python machine learning library for animal vocalizations and bioacoustics
<https://hybrid-vocal-classifier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/hybrid-vocal-classifier>  
combines `scikit-learn` with functionality for researchers studying animal vocalizations

- **evfuncs**  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/evfuncs>  
functions for working with files created by the EvTAF program and the evsonganaly GUI.  
The functions can be used to work with Bengalese finch song in this data repository:  
https://figshare.com/articles/Bengalese_Finch_song_repository/4805749  

- **birdsong-recognition-dataset**  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/birdsong-recognition-dataset>  
functions for working with this data repository:  
<https://figshare.com/articles/BirdsongRecognition/3470165>

- **ML-comparison-birdsong**  
https://github.com/NickleDave/ML-comparison-birdsong  
code to accompany the SciPy 2016 Proceedings Paper "Comparison of machine 
learning methods applied to birdsong element classification"  
<http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2016/david_nicholson.html>  

- **songdkl**  
https://github.com/NickleDave/songdkl  
a measure of similarity between birdsongs (and other things)  
As described in:  
Mets, David G., and Michael S. Brainard.
"An automated approach to the quantitation of vocalizations and vocal learning in the songbird."
PLoS computational biology 14.8 (2018): e1006437.  
<https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006437&rev=2>  
in collaboration with David Mets  

## visual search and visual attention
During my post-doctoral fellowship at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia,
I worked with [Astrid Prinz](http://www.biology.emory.edu/research/Prinz/index.html)
in the [Biology department](http://www.biology.emory.edu/),
on brain-inspired algorithms for continual machine learning,
as part of a [DARPA program](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2017-03-16).
The Prinz lab provided neuroscience expertise for members of our team
working on algorithms for goal-driven perception.
My goal for this project was to understand visual search:
how does our brain solve the problem of finding an object we're looking for?

- **untangling-search**
https://github.com/NickleDave/untangling-visual-search  
experiments to test whether the untangling mechanism proposed for object recognition 
can also account for behavior measured in visual search tasks, 
using deep neural network models of the primate ventral visual stream.

- **visual-search-nets**  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/visual-search-nets>  
library for modeling visual search behavior with neural networks.

- **searchstims**  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/searchstims>  
Python package to make stimuli like those used in classic visual search experiments.  

- **Recurrent Models of Visual Attention**  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/thrillington>  
replication of "Recurrent models of visual attention", Mnih et al. 2014

- **aver: active vision models in Nengo**  
<https://github.com/NickleDave/aver>  
framework for visual search models that incorporate eye movements.  
proposal for Nengo summer school 2019.
