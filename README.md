# About me
I do research in the areas of
machine learning, artificial intelligence, cognition, and neuroscience.

## Animal vocalizations and bioacoustics 

### **TweetyNet**  
Recently I collaborated with [Yarden Cohen](https://yardencsgithub.github.io/)
and [Tim Gardner](http://www.bu.edu/biology/people/profiles/tim-gardner/)
to develop a neural network that learns
how to segment and annotate birdsong from spectrograms:

### vocalpy
I develop a set of software tools for researchers studying vocal behavior:  
https://github.com/vocalpy

- **vak**  
<https://github.com/vocalpy/vak>  
neural network toolbox for animal vocalizations and bioacoustics

- **crowsetta**  
<https://github.com/vocalpy/crowsetta>  
a tool to work with any format for annotating animal vocalizations

- **hybrid-vocal-classifier**: a Python machine learning library for animal vocalizations and bioacoustics
<https://hybrid-vocal-classifier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>  
<https://github.com/vocalpy/hybrid-vocal-classifier>  
combines `scikit-learn` with functionality for researchers studying animal vocalizations

## Visual search and visual attention
During my post-doctoral fellowship at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia,
I worked with [Astrid Prinz](http://www.biology.emory.edu/research/Prinz/index.html)
in the [Biology department](http://www.biology.emory.edu/),
on brain-inspired algorithms for continual machine learning,
as part of a [DARPA program](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2017-03-16).
The Prinz lab provided neuroscience expertise for members of our team
working on algorithms for goal-driven perception.
My goal for this project was to understand visual search:
how does our brain solve the problem of finding an object we're looking for?

- **"Could simplified stimuli change how the brain performs visual search tasks? A deep neural network study"**
https://github.com/NickleDave/Nicholson-Prinz-JOV-DNNs-bio-vis  
"Here we use deep neural networks to test how optimizing models for the statistics of one distribution of images 
constrains performance on a task using images from a different distribution."
